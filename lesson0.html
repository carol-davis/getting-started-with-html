to create text content and to link to all file types e.g. pdf, video, music, etc.
<b>HTTP</b> is the protocol to communicate between your browser and servers, back and forth.<br><br>
HTML is used to create text content and to <em>markup</em> text or control it's appearance and link to other documents.
A markup tag is used to control appearance.
<br><br>
<b>HTML Attributes</b><br>
Some tags have attribute which have a value.  That is used to create links to other web pages.<br>
The "value" is the web address that you ponit them to to create the link.<br>
When making a link to an image you use the img tag using the url as the attribute name<br>
but you must also include a message that will display if the image doesn't load.<br>
Here is an example of an imbedded link: <a href="www.udacity.com">This Page</a> is our classroom page.
<br><br>
<b>Whitespace</b><br>
To put text on multiple lines you can use a br or "break" tag. This is called a VOID tag because
<br> it has no closing tag. Another whitespace tag is paragraph, p. This is a block tag. It has height<br>
and width associated with it.  Common inline tags are a,b,em,br,img,strong,span.  Some block<br>
tags are div, p, form.
